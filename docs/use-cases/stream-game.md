## Configure the streaming service

Steam Headless also integrates Sunshine, the streaming server. To stream games using Moonlight, you need to pair the host PC on moonlight with Sunshine. 

### Prepare for paring

1. From your Steam client in the browser, get the URL and append `:47990`, for example, `https://139ebc4f0.<your Olares ID>.olares.com:47990`. Open this URL to access the Sunshine console page.

   - Username: `sam`  
   - Password: `password` 

3. Click the **Pin** tab to open the pairing page, where you will be prompted to enter the pairing code.

### Stream remotely 

With Olares's VPN feature, you can enjoy a smooth streaming experience even across different networks.

<!--@include: ./remote.reusables.md{4,22}-->

Once VPN is enabled on your device, simply follow the same instructions as local streaming.

## FAQs

### Why isn't the game displaying in full screen?

This could be due to your resolution settings. Try adjusting the resolution:
- In Moonlight: adjust in **Settings** > **Basic Settings** > **Resolution and FPS**.
- On the Steam console page: adjust in **Applications** > **Settings** > **Display**.

- **On Mac**: Use the shortcut combo **Control (^) + Option (‚å•) + Shift + Q**.
