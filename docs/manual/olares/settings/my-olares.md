Access help resources or send feedback to the Olares team regarding your system experience.

## Change password

Update your Olares login password to enhance your account security.

## Set network access policy

Define system-level access and authentication policies to control how users connect to your Olares.

* **Network visibility**: Control how visible your Olares services are on the network. Options include:
  * **Public**: Services are accessible to anyone on the internet.
  * **Protected**: Services are public but require a login for access.
  * **Private**: Services are not exposed to the internet and are only accessible via VPN.
* **Login security requirement**: Set the authentication method for logging into Olares.
  * **Two-factor** (Recommended): Requires both your login password and a two-factor authentication code for enhanced security.
  * **One-factor**: Only requires your login password (less secure).

## View login history

Review a detailed record of all login attempts to your Olares account. Each entry displays the **Time**, **Status**, **Source IP Address**, and the **Reason for the attempt**.

## Device management

The **Devices** section allows you to view and manage all devices authorized to access your Olares. Each entry provides details about the connected device, such as its name, operating system, connection method, device IP address, and last connection time.

Available actions are:

* **View device information**: Click a specific device to view its detailed information such as software type, last active time, location, and token details.
* **Sign out device**: Use this option to remotely disconnect a device from your Olares. The device will need to reauthenticate to access Olares again.
